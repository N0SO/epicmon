# epicmon
epicmon - A utility to monitor and display status of a West Mountain Radio Epic Power Gate.

## NOTE: Development paused 2025/08/22 
Since retiring, the vehicle does not get driven frequently enough for the
Epic Powergate to keep the radio battery charged, so I removed it and stopped development of this project until I figure out what to do. Currently charging
the battery previously charged by the Epic manually.
